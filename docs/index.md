### Documentation

Coming soon.

### Contributing

Contributing is accepted! Fork and create a PR with your guides or edits.

When creating a guide, you can add the following to the top of your markdown page to specify that you wrote the page:

```yml
author_name: mineblock11
author_img: https://github.com/mineblock11.png
difficulty: easy|intermediate|advanced
description: This is a description
```

### Advert Disclaimer

This page isn't free to host, without adverts these guides wouldn't be able to be hosted - I pay $5.99 a month for a `cloudflared` proxy that allows me to host all content on the mineblock11 domain. All money from adverts go back into my sites, it isn't a profit thing.
