# minedocs

Welcome to minedocs, documentation for all of mineblock11's mods and modding guides and tutorials to help people get into modding Minecraft, written by mineblock11 and members of the community.

### Guides

All guides use yarn, as that is the majorly used mappings for Fabric. You can use [Linkie Mappings](https://linkie.shedaniel.me/mappings) to convert between mappings.

### Advert Disclaimer

This page isn't free to host, without adverts these guides wouldn't be able to be hosted - I pay $5.99 a month for a `cloudflared` proxy that allows me to host all content on the mineblock11 domain. All money from adverts go back into my sites, it isn't a profit thing.
